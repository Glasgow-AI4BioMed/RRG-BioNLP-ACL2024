# Gla-AI4BioMed at RRG24: Visual Instruction-tuned Adaptation for Radiology Report Generation

## Overview

We introduce a radiology-focused visual language model designed to generate radiology reports from chest X-rays. Building on previous findings that large language models (LLMs) can acquire multimodal capabilities when aligned with pretrained vision encoders, we demonstrate similar potential with chest X-ray images. Our model combines an image encoder with a fine-tuned LLM based on the Vicuna-7B architecture, enabling it to generate different sections of a radiology report with notable accuracy.

## Project Status

The code is currently being organised and will be available soon. Please check back later for updates.

## Acknowledgments

We extend our gratitude to the BioNLP 2024 RRG24 Shared Task organisers for providing the baseline pipeline ViLMedic and curating these challenging and exciting tasks. We also wish to acknowledge the University of Glasgow for providing the essential equipment and resources that supported our work.
